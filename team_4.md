The homepage is : _https://mybrowseraddon.com/adblocker-for-youtube.html_ .

The license is _Mozilla Public License, version 2.0_.
3. Can you find a code repository for this extension?  
I cannot find a code repository for this extension anywhere on github, the mozilla extension page, or the homepage for the extension. The license does state in section 3.2 that if the producted is distributed in executable form, the source code must be made accessible. Although I cannot find the code repository with the source code, I would assume it is available under an obscure name.
4. Is the extension that you picked an open source project?  
Since it is available on Mozilla (_an open source platform_) and its license dictates that it must also be open source, I would assume it is indeed open source.
5. Can you find information about how many different users contribute to this project? If so, specify how many.  
No private information about the users is made public, except for the fact that it is more than a single person's contributions.
