[MDN WebExtension repository](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) exploration:

1. What is the purpose of the `README.md` file? What kind of information should be included in it?

   The 'README.md' file serves as an introduction to the nature of a project and its function. Its
   contents include but aren't limited to:
   *  Project title and description
   *  Project authors/maintainers
   *  System requirements for running the project
   *  Instructions for project installation, testing and deployment
   *  Guidelines for making __meaningful__ project contributions
   *  A link to the license
   
2. What is the purpose of the `LICENSE` file? Does it need to be in a repository?

   Response here

3. What is the purpose of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file?

   The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file provides guidelines on the ways people can contribute and how these contributions should be
   structured. This file helps keep the repository codebase consistent and organized. For example, in the webextensions-
   examples repo, types of contributions are listed (such as creating, extending, or translating an example; or fixing a 
   bug). The file also mentions what code style should be used in a contribution, and how an example directory should be 
   structured.

4. Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code.

   One such repository contribution which fulfills the aforementioned condition would be answering
   these questions. In general, creating and editing documentation on GitHub doesn't 
   necessarily require writing code. The user simply reviews the Markdown syntax for text styling, 
   creates a new file, edits said file however they like and then commits it to the GitHub master branch.

5. What is the purpose of the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` document?

   Response here

6. Describe three types of behaviors that violate the _Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines_.

   Three types of behavior vehemently discouraged by the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines are
   violence and threats of violence against others, derogatory language of any kind and in any context,
   and gratuitous sexual attention or physical contact. Violence could include damaging foreign property,
   encouraging others to commit suicide, and blackmail. Derogatory language can range from purposefully
   misidentifying someone's gender to belittling a person's entire ethnic group (ex: People of Hispanic
   descent are compared to frogs in the context of behavior (think about it)). Gratuitous sexual attention
   and contact could include gazing at a person's sensitive areas for extended periods of time, groping, and
   lewd messages.
