## Part 3:

1. The purpose of the `README.md` file is to explain, more broadly, the origin and contents of the repository and how to use those contents.  Ideally, it should contain some indication of who created the repository, why they did so and where we can find more information, as well as how to install and run the contents (inclusion of debugging information is helpful).
2. The purpose of the `LICENSE` file is to specify how the contents of the repository may be used or reproduced. A license file should be included if the owners want to permit certain usages of the content: without a license file, the repository only has "code-available" content.
3. The purpose of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is to offer potential contributors some starting ideas on where they can contribute and get help with those contributions, but also, more importantly, provide guidelines and rules for contributing to the repository. In particular, the document specifies a code style convention, policy regarding updating examples.json, and expectations pertaining to licensing.
4. An example of a contribution that does not require writing any code is translating a localizable string in an example to another (human!) language. 
5. The purpose of the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` document is to refer contributors to Mozilla's _Community Participation Guidelines_ and _Developer Etiquette Guidelines_.
6. Three types of behavior that violate the _Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines_ are: a) violent or threatening language/actions; b) use of "derogatory language" against others; and c) making "unwelcome" sexual advances.  
7. Anyone who has trouble with the contents of the repository or who has further questions may either file a bug (if the circumstances warrant it), email the mailing list for add-ons development, or reach out to Mozilla's WebExtensions team.
