## Part 3:

1. The purpose of the README.md file is to explain, more broadly, the origin and contents of the repository and how to use those contents.  Ideally, it should contain some indication of who created the repository, why they did so and where we can find more information, as well as how to install and run the contents (inclusion of debugging information is helpful).
2. The purpose of the LICENSE file is to specify how the contents of the repository may be used or reproduced. A license file should be included if the owners want to permit certain usages of the content: without a license file, the repository only has "code-available" content.
3. The purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file is to explain how to contribute to the repository, along with style rules and recommendations.
