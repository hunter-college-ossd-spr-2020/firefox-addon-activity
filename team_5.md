1. The purpose of the README.md file is to provide others with instructions concerning the software application. Typically, there's information about how to run the program, any bugs or patches that the program currently has, or even information about recent updates to the application.  
2. The purpose of a LICENSE is to define permissions, limitations and conditions to users that may be looking to use their program in any shape or form. No a repository does not need to have a license because by default the work in that repo is under exclusive copyright, unless you specifiy that it isn't.  
3. The purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.MD file is to offer some insight to other potential contributers on how they can go about making contributions to your project whether that be code or non-code related.  
4. One particular type of contribution that one can make to the MDN WebExtension repository that doesn't require writing any code, but is listed in their CONTRIBUTING.md file, is to write a brand-new example that highlights and showcases a particular WebExtension API that currently has no examples.
