1. The purpose of the `README.md` file is to provide others with instructions concerning the software application. Typically, there's information about how to run the program, any bugs or patches that the program currently has, or even information about recent updates to the application.  
2. The purpose of a `LICENSE` is to define permissions, limitations and conditions to users that may be looking to use the work in which the license covers. A repository does not need to have a license because by default the work in that repo is under exclusive copyright, unless the owner of that repo specifies that it isn't.
3. The purpose of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is to offer some insight to other potential contributers on how they can go about making contributions to your project whether that be code or non-code related.  
4. One particular type of contribution that one can make to the MDN WebExtension repository that doesn't require writing any code, but is listed in their `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, is to write a brand-new example that highlights and showcases a particular WebExtension API that currently has no examples.  
5. The `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` document serves to establish appropriate behavior to the community of users that are contributing to a particular project. It is a set of rules, values, and expectations that the owner of the project believes are necessary to successfully operate within the community.
6. The following are violations of the *Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines*:
    * Making derogatory comments of someone's culture or religion is a direct violation of Mozilla's Community Participation Guidleines on `Appreciating and Accomodating Our Similarities and Differences` as it discriminates the participants based on their beliefs and customs. 
    * Sexualized comments, jokes or imagery of any kind (including any kind of physical touching without permission) falls under Mozilla's `Behaviors That Will Not Be Tolerated` category because it creates an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment that not only violates an individual's rights, but promotes a toxic atmosphere to the community. 
    * Being disruptive by causing hostility, or 'talking over' and heckling speakers at events, talks, presentations, forums, and/or meetings will not be tolerated under *Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines*. Encouraging or influencing others to participant in a similar disruptive behavior will also not be tolerated as it is counterproductive and creates a hostile community.
