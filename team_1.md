PART THREE
==============


**1. What is the purpose of the README.md file? What kind of information should be included in it?**
.md extension stands for markdown, and it generated at the bottom of the github page as html. It should include the title of the project along with a description of the project. It should also include a list of instructions that teaches other people how to run this project on the local machine for development and testing purposes. Other additional elements that can be included in README.md are illustration, examples of use, sources, contribution, license, and etc.
  
**2. What is the purpose of the LICENSE file? Does it need to be in a repository?**
 A LICENSE file tells other what they can and can't do with your source code. It does not need to be in a repository. Without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from yout work. It's encouraged to choose a type of license that is best fit for you.

**3. What is the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file?**

A CONTRIBUTING.md file provides potential project contributiors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group. It explains how a participant should do things like format code, text fixed, and submit patches.

**4. Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code.**

One way to contribute without needing to write any code is maintaining a FAQ or HOWTO document. You can also keep any cited references and informational sources that are used up to date by continuously checking them. 

**5. What is the purpose of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document?**
Due to the many freedoms that open scource provides the code of conduct is used to lay out any rules and prevent any possible abuses or exploits of the system. It is an agreement to uphold the work of others as well as the stability of the application or program. This is because the nature of open source does not completely protect against possible vandalism.

**6. Describe three types of behaviors that violate the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines.**  

Three types of behaviors not tolerated, according to the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines, are violence (or threats of violence), derogatory comments that are used for the sole purpose of discrimination, and personal attacks on individals.

**7. If a person working with the content of this repository runs into problems or has questions, what can they do?**
The best place to look for the answer to such questions is the README file where there are often sections for frequently asked questions or HOWTO directions. They can also reach out to the people who edit the directory for any information or insight they could provide.
