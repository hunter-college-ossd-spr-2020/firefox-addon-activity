**1. What is the purpose of the README.md file? What kind of information should be included in it?**

The purpose of the README.md file is to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.
The README file helps you communicate expectations for and manage contributions to your project.
The README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. 

README typically includes information on:
- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project 

**2. What is the purpose of the LICENSE file? Does it need to be in a repository?**

The LICENSE file determines whether or not software is open source. If there is **NO** license, then it is not open source. It does not necessarily _need_ to be in a repository, but it is good practice to do so. Some projects include information about the LICENSE in their README.

**3. What is the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file?**

A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help contribute to the project.

**4. Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code.**

We can write a brand new example that highlights a particular API. This example should have a clear function and should focus on demonstrating how to use the WebExtension technology.

**5. What is the purpose of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document?**

The purpose of this document is to require all those who participate in the open source project to "agree and adhere" to the stated Community Participation Guidelines. In this case, Mozilla has written their own Community Participation Guidelines, which helps them create a safe and positive community experience for all. They want everyone to contribute in a healthy and respectful manner.

**6. Describe three types of behaviors that violate the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines.**

1. Discriminating against someone based off of where they are from. 
2. Referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with.
3. Making sexualized comments directed at somebody.

**7. If a person working with the content of this repository runs into problems or has questions, what can they do?**

In the MDN webextensions-examples README file, it states that if you run into problems, then file a bug (and they give you a link where you can file the bug). And they also mentioned that if you needed help, then email the dev-addons mailing list, or to contact the WebExtensions team in the #webextensions channel on irc.mozilla.org. So I assume it is different per project, but I believe that the best practice would be to read the README, and, when in doubt, contact the owner.
